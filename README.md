# MERN-Stack-Restaurant-Website
A restaurnt website using MERN!!
A project made with MERN technology which is used for online seat reservation in restauranrs.
To provide precise step-by-step instructions, I will need to see the directory structure and the content of the package.json files. Since you haven't provided the exact structure or package.json files, I'll give you a general guide based on common practices for MERN stack projects.

### Step-by-Step Commands

1. *Unzip the project (if needed)*:
   bash
   unzip MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main.zip
   cd MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main
   

2. *Install dependencies*:

   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     

   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     

3. *Start the backend server*:
   - Ensure you are in the backend directory and start the server:
     bash
     cd ../backend
     npm start
     

4. *Start the frontend server*:
   - Open a new terminal window or tab.
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and start the server:
     bash
     cd /path/to/MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main/frontend
     npm start
     

### Notes:
- If the project has a different structure (e.g., the backend and frontend directories have different names or are located differently), adjust the commands accordingly.
- If there are specific scripts defined in your package.json for starting the project (e.g., npm run dev instead of npm start), use those commands.

If you can upload the package.json files, I can tailor the commands to match the exact setup of your project.
