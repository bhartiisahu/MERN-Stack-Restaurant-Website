# MERN-Stack-Restaurant-Website
A restaurnt website using MERN!!
A project made with MERN technology which is used for online seat reservation in restauranrs.
To provide precise step-by-step instructions, I will need to see the directory structure and the content of the package.json files. Since you haven't provided the exact structure or package.json files, I'll give you a general guide based on common practices for MERN stack projects.

Here's a step-by-step guide with the commands to set up and run your MERN Stack Restaurant Reservation project:

### 1. **Unzip the Project (if needed)**
If your project is in a zip file, you need to unzip it first. If it's already unzipped, you can skip this step.

```bash
unzip MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main.zip
cd MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

#### a. Navigate to the Backend Directory and Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### b. Navigate to the Frontend Directory and Install Dependencies
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. **Start the Backend Server**

Ensure you are in the backend directory and start the server:

```bash
cd ../backend
npm start
```

### 4. **Start the Frontend Server**

Open a new terminal window or tab, then navigate to the frontend directory and start the server:

```bash
cd /path/to/MERN_STACK_RESTAURANT_RESERVATION-main/frontend
npm start
```

This will start both your backend and frontend servers, allowing you to work with your project locally.

If you face any issues during these steps, feel free to ask for help!

### Notes:
- If the project has a different structure (e.g., the backend and frontend directories have different names or are located differently), adjust the commands accordingly.
- If there are specific scripts defined in your package.json for starting the project (e.g., npm run dev instead of npm start), use those commands.

If you can upload the package.json files, I can tailor the commands to match the exact setup of your project.
